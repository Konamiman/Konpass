          Contains some VERY NASTY BUGS:
          *does not run under DOS1
          *no correct PUSHing in the debugger
#1.1 :some minor bugs were removed, but the above mentioned bugs were still
      there...

1996: the 'old' Compjoetania members stopped programming for the 
MSX-system. Except David Heremans; he gathered some other MSX-minded 
people to start a new group: Compjoetania The Next Generation.
The old members promised to give us the Compass sources so that we could 
continue the development. 
Some phonecalls later...
June 1997: nothing received yet...
July 1997: Compjoetania TNG starts from scratch all over. We disassembled
           Compass #1.1 with... Compass #1.1!!!

Compjoetania The Next Generation


Bugfixes in #2.0beta.01
-----------------------
*CALL in debugger works now
*some minor screenissues concerning returning from Userscreen fixed
*REGfile loading in DOS1 works fine now

Release of #2.0beta.00
----------------------

Bugfixes in #1.2.09
-------------------
*assembly of a macrodefinition with more than one parameter did lock up when it was preceded by a line with a long argument. Fixed.
*INCLUDE problems when assembling to disk fixed
*better INCLUDE errorlist handling

Bugs still present in #1.2.09:
------------------------------
*Sometimes the labelbuffer isn't cleared properly. The computer may crash 
 when displaying the labellist.
*Compass crashes when you call the memorymenu when working with MemMan
 in DOS1 environment. Probably a MemMan bug.
*Incompatibilities with Gen80: Compass uses @sym (Gen80: @$ym) Compass may
 crash if you use @$ym. The DEFL instructions in both programs are different.

Bugfix in #1.2.08
-----------------
*assembly of IF with strings like IF "Compass">"GPS" screwed up the kernel

Changes in #1.2.07
------------------
*Bugfix diskmenu: errorlist was damaged after using the diskmenu
*Enhancement debugger: better adjustment of subslot register values

Changes in #1.2.06
------------------
*ROM detection enhancements
*Bugfix editor: 'ret insert' problems fixed
*Bugfix editor: ASCII file loading problems fixed; no more duplication of
 lines preceding empty ASCII lines (e.g. #20,#20,#0d,#0a)

Changes in #1.2.05
------------------
*ROM detection enhancements

Changes in #1.2.04
------------------
*Bugfix debugger: after 'Execute till BP' the P-shortcut didn't work fine.
*Code optimization assemblymodule (somewhat faster)
*No more crashing when returning from BASIC shell in DOS1 !!!

Changes in #1.2.03
------------------
*Bugfix debugger: if the last instruction you traced was a PUSH or a POP and
 you exited the debugger, then the SP had again its old value when you
 re-entered the debugger.
*Chaining to debuggercursor works fine now
*New handy feature in debugger: shortcut I sets SP back to initial value

Changes in #1.2.02
------------------
Changes to the debugger:
*Code optimization, faster screenoutput (=faster scrolling)
*Realtime updated minimonitor and stackviewer
*IN r,(C) checks for port #A8 and mapperports now
*Bugfix: breakpoints are removed correctly with specialtracefeature
*Bugfix: correct secondaryslot-emulation when writing to port #A8
*Bugfix: correct secondaryslot-emulation when writing to address #FFFF
*Better emulation of #FFFF registers
Changes to the monitor:
*New feature built in: possibility to chain monitoraddress to
 debuggeraddresses

Bugfix of the UNOFFICIAL command LOOP in #1.2.01
------------------------------------------------

Release of #1.2.00
------------------

Debuggerbugs removed in #1.2beta.06:
------------------------------------
*tracing IN A,(#A8) is correct now
*tracing LD (HL),n is correct now
*IN A,(#FC/FD/FE/FF) is really emulated now:
 example: IN A,(#FF) gives now #F0 on a 128kB mappersystem,
          in former versions this gave #00

Assembly bugs removed in #1.2beta.05:
-------------------------------------
*JR/DJNZ offsets are correct now. They were wrong when you used JR/DJNZ in an
 IF-block that was not compiled.
*No more problems with long DB/DEFB/DW/DEFW/DC/DEFC statements
*Enhancements to DB/DC compiling: numerical operations on the last character
 of a string is allowed now. For example: DB "TNI"-2 is compiled as "TNG"

Bug removed in #1.2beta.04:
---------------------------
*The editorparameters of all 4 sourcebuffers are properly loaded now

Bug/Changes in #1.2beta.03:
---------------------------
*The editorparameters (e.g. labellenght,...) are properly loaded now
*Backgroundcolor is set to black at startup. In the previous versions, it was
 impossible to see the startupmessages when backgroundcolor was white.
*When the installing of saved memory is not successful, the workmemory is set
 to the TPAsegments. Except page 0, ROMbios is set here.
*MemMan is allowed under DOS1. This DOES NOT mean that it will work. So do not
 use MemMan under DOS1 conditions. Perhaps this will be fixed in future.

Bug removed in #1.2beta.02:
---------------------------
*Correct assembly of lines like: defb 't'+1
 This bug is important enough to release a new version for!

Bugs removed in #1.2beta.01:
----------------------------
*F2 monitorbug fixed
*PO/PE indicator in debugger fixed

The differences between #1.1 and #1.2beta
-----------------------------------------
following bugs were removed:
*working under MSX-DOS1
*Crashing when the main ramslot(=TPAslot) was not the same as when you 
 performed a 'Save Installations'. (e.g. when you placed an extra 
 memorymapper in the computer.)
*PUSHing in the debugger works fine now. The error was situated in the 
 Main Install routines.
*When Compass was started with a successful 'Installing saved memory:Ok'
 under DOS2 (without MemMan), all available memory (with a limit of
 384*16kB) was not freed. This resulted in a 'Not enough memory' in the 
 shell and you couldn't use unused segments in the Memorymenu. This did 
 not happen under MemMan because of the automatic uncrashing of MemMan.
 Fixed.
*Formatting under DOS1 was a disaster for people with several diskdrives. 
 This was no problem because Compass v1.1 did not work under DOS1. 
 Problems fixed.
*Checking ROM/RAM routine is incredibly enhanced. No more crashing on 
 7MHz computers. No more wrong detection of ROMsegments because of 
 undefined databus state on some MSX computers. Compass detects now also 
 'fixed' rammodules less than 64kB. (only in page 0,1 or 2)
*When you entered no characters when asked for (e.g. Searchfunction and 
 you typed nothing at the 'Replace'line) then the Compassprogram poked 
 some zerobytes in the program! fixed.
*A lot of other errors which occurred in special cases like the fact that 
 segments weren't freed at startup when a compass-loaderror was encountered.

Bugs not removed in #1.2beta.00:
--------------------------------
*When you press repeatedly F2 in the monitorprogram and press left and 
 right, the background will be screwed up.
*Editorparameters (labellenght, etc.) are not installed at startup
*Sometimes a line you just edited in the assembler disappears when you
 press Return. This is the case when you used a new label in this line
 that you just declared in another sourcebuffer.
*Sometimes the labelbuffer isn't cleared properly. The computer may crash 
 when asking to show the labels.
*The PO/PE indicator in the debugger is not correct
*Incorrect assembly of lines like: db 't'+1
*incorrect calculation of offsets for JR and DJNZ when using IF/ENDIF
 constructions that were not compiled and contain JR/DJNZ.
*Compass crashes when trying to go back from the BASIC shell under DOS1
*Incompatibilities with Gen80: Compass uses @sym (Gen80: @$ym) Compass may
 crash if you use @$ym. The DEFL instructions in both programs are different
*Incorrect assembly of lines with db/dw and lots of arguments behind it.
*Memorymanagement of debugger is not perfect yet: wrong IN A,(#A8) etc.

Important differences between Compass #1.1 and #1.2(beta):
----------------------------------------------------------
Mainroutines have been totally rewritten! The original memoryroutines at 
startup were shit! (Lots of bugs, rather slow when using large memorymappers)
The routines for setting the automatic configuration (when doing a search 
memory) are a lot better now. Compass will try to use ramsegments in 
non-tpaslots first. Exception is made for the second Compassprogramblock 
and the first Labelbuffersegment. These two segments must be in the tpaslot.

Compass can run under 4 memorymanagement conditions:
*no memorymanagement (DOS1), Compass will use its own routines
 TPAsegmentnumbers: 3,2,1 and 0
*DOS2 mapper support: without MemMan
 TPAsegmentnumbers: reading #F2C7/8/9/A at startup
*MemMan: in DOS2 environment with MemMan active
 TPAsegmentnumbers: special GETTPA function of MemMan
 This function is available since MemMan version 2.40. When running an older
 version of MemMan, numbers 3,2,1 and 0 will be used.
*MemMan: in DOS1 environment: TPAsegentnumbers: same as above
         WE RECOMMEND NOT TO WORK WITH MEMMAN UNDER DOS1
         Perhaps this will be fixed in future versions.

Other changes
-------------
*The cursor in the diskmenu starts now at 'Dir'. (People who have erased
 a file by mistake because of pressing Return when the cursor started at
 'Save' know why this is done)
*The initial StackPointer in the debugger has been changed from #DE00 to
 the REAL stackpointer (when entering Compass) minus 512 bytes.
*Get the complete Compass version number by typing TYPE COMPASS.DAT or
 COMPASS.COM at the MSX-DOS prompt. 
*A 'hidden' feature! When you start Compass when pressing the [SHIFT]
 key, Compass will allocate a maximum of nine ramsegments. In future
 versions this number will be changeable.
*Before Compass is launched at startup, you can pause the program by
 pressing [STOP] to read the startupmessages if they disappear too
 early. Press this key again to continue and launch Compass.
