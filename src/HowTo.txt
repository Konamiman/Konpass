How to build Compass 1.2.09
---------------------------


* With sjasm:

You need sjasm 0.39i or newer (do NOT use sjasm 0.42), you can get it from https://github.com/Konamiman/Sjasm/releases

Simply run the following and you'll get the COMPASS.COM and COMPASS.DAT files ready to use:

sjasm -c compass.asm


* With Compass itself (or another compatible assembler):

COMfile:
compile MAKECOM.ASM into MAKECOM.COM
compile COMFILE.ASM into COMPASS.COM
Make sure you have the files PALET.BIN and CTNG.COP in the same directory
run MAKECOM.COM
This will strip off some headers from PALET.BIN and CTNG.COP and add it to the COMPASS.COM file.

DATfile:
compile MAIN.ASM  into MAIN.DAT
compile EDITOR.ASM  into EDITOR.DAT
compile ASMROUT.ASM   into ASMROUT.DAT
compile MONITOR.ASM    into MONITOR.DAT
compile DEBUGGER.ASM into DEBUGGER.DAT
compile MAKEDAT.ASM  into MAKEDAT.COM
run MAKEDAT 09
This will add all DAT file together with a 128 byte header into COMPASS.DAT
