# Konpass

Konpass is an assembler IDE for MSX computers, complete with debugger and monitor. Minimum system requirements are a MSX2 computer with 128K RAM (256K if you use MSX-DOS 2).

Version 1.0 was developed in 1995 by Compjoetania, and the last version, 1.2.09, was released in 1999 by Compjoetania TNG (yes, these were two different groups of people; see [the versions file](docs/COMPASSV.TXT) for the full story).

Compass was a paid product, but in 2021 it was published for free including the source code: [Compass 1.2.09 repository in GitHub](https://github.com/turbor/compass-1.2-sources). These sources are the basis of code in this repository.
