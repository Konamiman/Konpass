# Compass

Compass is an assembler IDE for MSX computers, complete with debugger and monitor. Minimum system requirements are a MSX2 computer with 256K RAM.

Version 1.0 was developed in 1995 by Compjoetania, and the last version, 1.2.09, was released on 1999 by Compjoetania TNG (yes, these were two different groups of people; see [the versions file](docs/COMPASSV.TXT) for the full story).

Compass was a paid product, but in 2021 it was published for free including the source code: [Compass 1.2.09 repository in GitHub](https://github.com/turbor/compass-1.2-sources). These sources are the basis of code in this repository.
